                                <p>In the case of three-time (or more) matches in friendly football matches and tournaments, all positions are considered 1.0 (one integer) unless otherwise specified in the program.</p>
                                <p>In the case of changing the duration of the time of standard two-time friendly matches and tournaments, the positions are not canceled, i.e. the coefficient is not counted as 1.0 (one whole), regardless of whether the duration of the time is indicated or not; (unless the duration of one of the halves is less than 30 minutes and it is not indicated in the title. In this case, the stakes will be considered as equal to 1.)</p>
                                <p>The bookmaker does not take any responsibility and does not consider claims regarding the accuracy of translation of names of teams, players, etc., on the lists of sports competitions. All information regarding the name of certain sports competitions (tournament stage, neutral pitch, etc.) is informative and its incorrectness or absence may not be a prerequisite for the cancellation of the bet.</p>
                                <p>When sports tournaments are held in a particular country or city, e.g. World Championships, European Championships, Olympic games and more, teams or players in a pair may be named according to the tournament bracket, which may result in the tournament host team or player being named as a second team or player in the pair, regardless of the status of the tournament host.</p>
                                <p>In case of holding a match in a neutral pitch, no matter which team or player in the pair is named first or second team / player. In the case of an existing situation, the bet is not considered as canceled. Also, the bet does not have to be canceled: various tournament matches listed in the bookmaker program as friendly matches.</p>
                                <p>If the game has been moved to the pitch of the opposing team (excluding one city teams) the coefficient of the accepted stake is 1.0 and the sum is issued with a coefficient of 1.0. If the international match is moved to another country, the bets will be paid on a coefficient equal to 1.0. In the case of friendly games, unless the program specifies the place of the match, all bets remain valid and such an event will not be considered as a basis for cancelling the betting.</p>
                                <p>If the match is over and the result is fixed, but for some reason this result is canceled, changed or re-assigned, only the original result will be awarded. 1.0 (one whole) is considered as the only odds-based bets placed on the team's next stage in two-match tournaments and received prior to the first match (referring to the change, cancellation and rescheduling of the first match).</p>
                                <p>A bet on a single match will be refunded to the player in case of postponement and / or non-holding match (the match did not take place within the next day of the program date). In case when the ticket contains several match forecasts and one and / or several matches are canceled for any reason, the result of this match (matches) will be considered as a player's (guessed ones) odds ratio of 1.0, and the result of the remaining matches will be considered in accordance with the existing rules.</p>
                                <p>If the match is played incompletely, i.e. the early disrupted match (after one day expires) has been extended from the moment of termination and nothing is stated in the odds table, all bets on this (renewed incomplete) match will be void. But, if the duration of the match to be specified (e.g. match lasts from minute 63) is indicated, bets will be taken on account of the score and playing time.</p>
                                <p>If an error has occurred in the program that allows the player to make a risk-free profit, such a bet will be void and the amount refunded to the player with a 1.0 (one integer) coefficient.</p>
                                <p>The Company reserves the right to void a bet (including a win) if a bookmaker and / or computer program has made a mechanical error as a result of which the coefficient and / or index (total, handicap) specified in the program is clearly does not match a real one (coefficient for the indicated position on the stock market) and / or it is due to a comma or, the full stop, etc. (For example, instead of the draw 3.15 is written 31.50, instead of the ball total 2.5 is written 250, instead of total in more-less 10.0 is written 1.0, instead of handicap 1.5 is 15, ...). A similar rule applies in case of getting the handicap and total by mistake.</p>
                                <p>Mirror Errors - when coefficient locations are changed. In such cases the match favorite (including the current favorite of the "live game") is assigned a higher coefficient than the outsider. E.g.:
                                    basketball. Real Madrid M. Unicca. Match coefficients instead of 1.3 and 3.5 are shown as 3.5 and 1.3.</p>
                                <p>There is an obvious error indicator - the big difference between the Winfinity N.V. coefficient and the other bookmaker companies.</p>
                                <p>A coefficient that was impossible to be given in such situations.</p>
                                <p>Whether a "blatant" or "technical" mistake was made or not, only the Winfinity N.V. has the right to determine it.</p>
                                <p>No translation or grammatical error shall be taken into consideration.</p>
                                <p>In case of errors in the list of events, if there is an evidence of a non-sporting fight, while accepting the stakes to avoid these rules and also in case of having other arguments, which confirms the incorrectness of the bet, the administration reserves the right to declare the stakes invalid in such conditions and the bets are paid out considering the coefficient equal to 1.0.</p>
                                <p>Bets on alternate matches (Alternate Matches: in these bets the results of the teams are compared in accordance with the mentioned matches played) will be counted considering the coefficient 1.0 (one integer), if one of the matches is delayed (not played) or one of the matches had a technical result.</p>
