Types of bets</p><p>3.1. To make a bet, Organizer offers the following types of bets: Single, Multi and System.</p><p>Single – The minimum stake for betting on the internet site is set 1 (one) EUR or its equivalent in another currency. The maximum stake on the internet site is set 5 000 (five thousand) EUR or its equivalent in other currency. In this type, you need to predict the outcome of one event. Single bets are accepted on any event specified in the program. The winning amount of a single bet is equal to the product of the bet amount and the odds of the given outcome.</p><p>&nbsp;Multi – in this type, you need to predict the outcomes of more than one independent event (the possible maximum number of events in Multi bet is 30. If at least one outcome of an event in Multi bet has been predicted wrong, the multi-bet is considered lost. Any combination of any independent events can be included in the Multi bet if nothing else is intended by the rules of the games organized by the Regulations. Dependent events cannot be included in the Multi bet. The same event cannot be included in the Multi bet more than once. If there were related dependent outcomes of the same event in the Multi bet, the event with the highest odds remains for calculation.</p><p>The odds of a Multi bet are equal to the product of the odds of all the events included. The winning amount of a Multi bet is equal to the product of the bet amount and the odds of the Multi bet.&nbsp; Multi bets may not be accepted on certain events at the Organizer’s discretion, also the player may be provided with an additional opportunity not to lose a Multi bet. At the organizer’s discretion, the participant can be given an extra chance to not lose the multi bet which the participant will be informed about beforehand via the system or the website of the organizer. If a multi bet contains 6 and more events, and the odd of winning for every event is no less than 1.7, and if only one event outcome in this multi-bet was predicted incorrectly but other events in the multi bet won by the established odds, then this multi bet is not considered lost and the played sum will be refunded.</p><p>The minimum stake for betting via the internet site is 1 (one) EUR or its equivalent in other currency, and the maximum stake is 5 000 (five thousand) EUR or an equivalent currency.</p><p>System – In this type, the bet is made on a full combination of a certain number of one-dimensional Multi bets (variants of the system) previously selected from the group of events and differing from each other by at least one event (the maximum number of events in the system is 16).The minimum stake for betting via the internet site is 0,3 EUR or its equivalent in other currency, and the maximum stake is 5 000 (five thousand) EUR or an equivalent currency.</p><p>System is characterized by the same bet amount for each variant (multi-bet) and the same number of events in each variant (multi). In the system, each combination (variant) is calculated as a separate multi. In this type of bet you need to specify the total number of events for the system and the number of events for one variant (multi). The bet amount for one variant (multi bet) is determined by piding the total bet amount by the number of variants (multi bets). The winning amount of a system is equal to the sum of winnings on multi bets included in the system. The number and ratio of the variants included in the system is determined by the organizer and may be changed at Organizer’s discretion at any time. The list of the number and ratio of the variants included in the system is promulgated either as attached to the program or separately from it.</p><p>For example, let’s consider a bet on a 2/3 system. As a bet amount we conditionally assume 30 EUR.</p><p>Let’s choose the outcomes of the events:</p><p>Event<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>Outcome</p><p>&nbsp;<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>W1<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Х<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>W2</p><p>Inter M - Ajax<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>1.5<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>4.2<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>7.5</p><p>Bayer L - Mainz<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>1.75<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>3<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>5.5</p><p>Sharapova M - Ivanovich A<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>1.45<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>-<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>2.5</p><p>Let's choose the results of the event:</p><p>Event<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Result<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Odds</p><p>Inter M – Ajax<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>W1<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>1.5</p><p>Bayer L – Mainz<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>X<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>3</p><p>Sharapova M – Ivanovich A<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>W2<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>2.5</p><p>The number of variants (accumulator bets) in the 2/3 system is 3:</p><p>Variant (multi ) 1<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Variant (multi ) 2<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Variant (multi ) 3</p><p>Outcome<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Odds<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Outcome<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>Odds<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Outcome<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>Odds</p><p>Inter M – Ajax W 1<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>1.5<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>Inter M – Ajax</p><p><br></p><p>W 1<span style=\"white-space:pre\">    </span>Sharapova M – Ivanovich A&nbsp; &nbsp; W2<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>2.5</p><p>Bayer L – Mainz&nbsp; X<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>3<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>Sharapova M – Ivanovich A&nbsp; &nbsp;W 2<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>2.5<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>Bayer L – Mainz&nbsp; X<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>3</p><p>So the bet amount for 1 variant (multi-bet) will be 10 EUR (30/3 = 10).</p><p>According to the variants there will be the following winnings:</p><p>1st variant = 1.5 x 3 x 10 EUR = 45 EUR,</p><p>2nd variant = 1.5 x 2.5 x 10 EUR = 37,5 EUR,</p><p>3rd variant = 2.5 x 3 x 10 EUR = 75 EUR</p><p>The winning amount on the system will be equal to the sum of winnings on all the 3 variants: 45 + 37.5 + 75 = 157. 5 EUR.</p><p>In case of a wrong prediction of the outcomes of 2 or more events in the 2/3 system the system is considered to be lost (all 3 variants lose). In case of a wrong prediction of any one of the outcomes only 1 variant wins. For example, suppose that the outcome of the match Inter M. – Ajax has been predicted wrong (Ajax won the match), in this case the 1st and 2nd variants are considered to be lost and the winning amount on the system is equal to the winning amount on the 3rd variant – 75 EUR.</p><p>3.2.In all bet types, the maximum winning sum for one ticket is 10 000 EUR /ten thousand/ or equivalent bet, regardless of number of bets, included in the ticket.</p><p>4. Making changes in the betslip&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;4.1. Making changes in the betslip (Cheque redact) – it's a tool, which, in case of being activated, allows a participant to make changes and/or add new outcomes of events in the already accepted bet.</p><p>4.2. In online betting the availability of the Tool is determined by the corresponding button \"Cheque redact\" in the game window of a participant's personal page.</p><p>4.3. When placing bets the outcomes of not started events (pre-match) in Multi bets can be replaced by outcomes of both - not started (pre-match) and started (on-line) events. At the time of replacement, the odds of the event outcome, by which the already accepted event outcome is replaced, must be equal to or higher than the event outcome, which is replaced.</p><p>For example, let’s suppose the following Multi bet was made:</p><p>Event<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Event outcome<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>Odds</p><p>Real M. - Barcelona<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>W2<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>1.5</p><p>Juventus - Milan<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>W1<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>1.7</p><p>A participant can replace any of these event outcomes by another event outcome.</p><p>For example, he can replace \"Juventus – Milan W1 1.7\" by \"Inter M – Ajax W1 2.0\", if the organizer offers odds of 2.0 or lower for the match \"Juventus – Milan P1\" at the moment.</p><p>In this case the bet will be as follows:</p><p>Event<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Event outcome<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>Odds</p><p>Real M. - Barcelona<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>W2<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>1.5</p><p>Inter M. - Ajax<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>W1<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>2.0</p><p>When the Tool is active and the above-mentioned rules are followed, the number of replacements is not limited. Any replacement of an outcome of the event by another outcome of the same event is not allowed.</p><p>Adding a new event outcome in the betslip: The bets made on the outcomes of not started (pre-match) and already started (on-line) events can be supplemented with new outcomes of not started (pre-match) and already started (on-line) events, except for the cases when more than one Single bet was made with one betslip.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>After adding another event outcome in a Single bet, it becomes a Multi bet. The Multi bet resulting from addition of a new event outcome is subject to the rules of Multi bet established by the Regulations of organizing and conducting the lottery.</p><p>Example 1. Let’s suppose the following Single bet was made:</p><p><br></p><p>Event<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Event outcome<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>Odds</p><p>Real M. - Barcelona<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>W2<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>1.5</p><p>A participant can include another event outcome (e.g. Juventus – Milan W1 1.7) in the betslip, thus changing the Single to Multi bet.</p><p>Example 2. Let’s suppose the following Multi bet was made:</p><p>Event<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Event outcome<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>Odds</p><p>Real M. - Barcelona<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>W2<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>1.5</p><p>Juventus - Milan<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>W1<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>1.7</p><p>A participant can include another event outcome (e.g. Bayer L – Mainz W1) in the betslip, thus turning the Multi bet with two outcomes into a Multi bet with three outcomes.</p><p>When adding a new event outcome, there is no requirement of setting a minimum limit for the odds of the new event outcome to be added. In such cases the possible number of bets to be added is set in accordance with the maximum number of bets established by these Regulations.</p><p>&nbsp;When changing a betslip placed on the Internet, the system doesn’t confirm the removal of the bet, if the Tool is deactivated after removing the bet to be changed.</p><p>5. The main rules of accepting bets</p><p>&nbsp;5.1. Bets are accepted only from those persons who agree with the rules laid down by the organizer. Any placed bet is confirmation that the participant knows the rules of the lottery and completely agrees with them.</p><p>5.2. Bets are accepted until the actual start of the event, except online bets. In case for some reason the bet has been placed after the actual start of the event it is considered to be payable with odds of 1, except for current online bets.</p><p>&nbsp;5.3. Online bets are the bets which are accepted during the event at organizer’s discretion. In this case bets can be accepted only until the outcome of the event becomes known. The bets placed after the outcome of the event becomes known are considered to be payable with odds of 1. The information provided by the organizer about the event during accepting online bets (the score, time played, etc.) is for informational purposes only and cannot be a basis for bet calculation.</p><p>&nbsp;5.4. The Organizer has a right to return the bet amount at any time before the actual start of the event. In this case the placed bet or bets are considered to be payable with odds of 1, and the organizer makes an announcement about it either via corresponding changes in the program or through other information sources.</p><p>5.5. It is not allowed to make bets on the event, in which the bettor has direct involvement, as well as if the event is considered to be fixed. For example, if the bettor is a participant of the match, referee, team’s owner, coach, or if based on a written confirmation of the organization Federbet AISBL (http://federbet.com), there was an agreement on the event outcome between the participants of the match, referees, coaches or the two teams, etc. Making a bet, the participant confirms that he doesn't know the event outcome, on which he made a bet. In case of violation of these terms, as well as in case of making bets on fixed events, the Organizer has the right not to pay out the winnings and consider the bet subject to being paid out with odds of 1.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>5.6. In all cases when the bet is considered to be paid with odds of 1, it must be refunded, and if the bet is included in the multi bet or system it is calculated by odds “1” (one), i.e. it doesn’t affect the results of the other events included in the multi bet or system.</p><p>&nbsp;5.7. All bets are accepted based on the events of the proposed program (line) according to the odds defined by the organizer. A unique number is provided for each event in the program, and the final date and time for accepting bets on the events are specified. The date and time of start of the event specified in the program are informative. The date specified incorrectly is not basis for considering the bet void.&nbsp; In case the event took place earlier or later than at the initially announced time the result is not considered to be paid with odds of 1. In that case the bets are considered valid if they have been placed before the actual start of the event. The bets placed after the actual start of the event are considered to be paid with odds of 1 (except online bets). For calculating bets the actual time of beginning of the event is assumed as the start of the event, and that time is determined based on the information provided by the official organizer or organizers of the event.</p><p>5.8.The “Event” column provides the names of the competing teams or the events on which bets are accepted. In the list of the events the first name to appear is the name of the team which hosts the match. If the match takes place on the ground of the team which is specified on the second place of the list, the bets placed on that match are calculated by odds “1” (one), except for the following cases:</p><p>a) Both teams are from the same city,</p><p>b) The matches take place in the same city, in case of international tournaments – in the same country,</p><p>c) When it is the final round of the cup matches.&nbsp;</p><p>Transferring the match to a neutral ground is not basis for invalidating the bets.</p><p>The next in the program come the outcomes of the events, odds, handicap, total with their conventional signs (for example: the English version – Date, Football: England – Belgium event, the outcome of the event: win of the first team – W1, Odds – 1.28, Total – 2.5 over – 1.7, under – 2, handicap for the first team – 1.5.</p><p>5.9.The program may contain other information which has significant importance while placing bets and enables the participant to use the program correctly as well as understand the meaning and essence of the conventional signs contained in it.</p><p>&nbsp;5.10. In the inpidual tennis tournaments, as well as in the matches of the final round of big tournaments, which take place in one country, the competitors’ order in a pair is free.</p><p>&nbsp;5.11. In case the event which has not yet started is postponed for no more than 24 hours the bets remain, and in case 24 hours pass the bets are refunded. If during 24 hours there is information about postponing the event for more than 24&nbsp; hours the final decision about the bets being valid or refunded is made by the bookmakers’ office if nothing else is intended by regulations. If the matches of NBA, NHL, NFL, baseball (MLB) do not take place on the appointed day, the bet amounts are refunded immediately the next day, except for the cases when the specified date was wrong.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>5.11.The started event may be interrupted, i.e. may not play up to the end for some reason. The event which has been interrupted and has not been finished during 24 hours is considered completed if played for no less than: 40 min. in basketball (NBA), 35 min. in European basketball; in these cases the outcome (the actual result) of the event considered to be completed is the result recorded at the moment of interruption of the event (except tennis). In all other cases the event is considered to be not completed, including interruption of the match at the time of tie in those sports where tie is not allowed (basketball, baseball, NHL hockey playoffs, etc.), and the bets (including online bets) must be refunded.</p><p>5.12.If the event has been interrupted and is considered to be not completed, those outcomes which are determined at the time of its interruption and do not depend on the final result of the event (for example, the team will score, who will score the first goal the outcome of the first half, etc.) are taken as a basis for calculating the bets (including online bets).</p><p>5.13.While calculating the bets on the statistics of one round (tour) or one game day, if one or several events (matches) are not considered to be completed the bets are calculated by odds “1”, except the bets the results of which are definitely clear regardless of whether other events (matches) have taken place or not.</p><p>For example: suppose in the championship of Italy's Serie A in one of the rounds (tours) two of the ten matches haven’t taken place, five matches have ended with home win, two matches have ended with away win, one match has ended with a 2:2 score.</p><p>If there are bets on that:</p><p>a) at least five of the matches of this round will end with home win,&nbsp;</p><p>b) there will be 2:2 score in the round,</p><p>these bets are considered to be won.</p><p>If there are bets on that</p><p>a) at least three of the matches of this round will end with away win,</p><p>b) total number of goals scored in the round will be even,these bets must be refunded (will be calculated by odds “1”).</p><p>If there is a bet on that there will not be a 2:2 score in any match of the round, this bet is considered to be lost.</p><p>&nbsp;In case of errors generated either by employees or software flaws (obvious mistakes in the software, odds, totals, handicaps, discrepancy of odds in different places, non-typical, false odds, etc.) and arguments verifying the inaccuracy of the bet (including online bets), the bet is considered invalid and is subject to refund irrespective of its winning or losing.</p><p>&nbsp;5.14. If there is a technical error but it does not affect the result of the event, the bet is calculated according to the defined odds. Example: if the \"CSKA\" – \"Zenith\" match of the championship of Russia has appeared in the list of the championship of Spain, it will be calculated according to the defined odds, unless there are teams with the same names in the championship of Spain.</p><p>&nbsp;5.15.The Organizer is not responsible for absolutely accurate translation of the names of players, teams, cities where the event takes place. In such cases the bets are not considered to be paid with odds of 1.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.16. Complaints on controversial issues are accepted in a written statement during 5 days after the end of the event. During discussion of controversial issues which have no precedent and are not regulated by these regulations the final decision is made by the organizer of the lottery.</p><p>6. Cashout – function via which the participant has the right to close his/her bet for the sum offered by the Organizer, avoiding losses or wins as a result of event outcome.</p><p>6.1.This function will be available for all bets, for which a Cashout symbol will be active. In this case the participant can click on the button and see the sum, which is offered by the organizer for the bet. The organizer can offer the sum, which is higher, lower or equal to the possible win. The organizer is also allowed not to make any offers.</p><p>6.2. If the participant agrees not to receive the suggested sum, he/she should confirm his/her wish by clicking the relevant button. He/she will receive the sum, offered by the organizer. After that the bet will be closed. If the participant doesn’t use this function or doesn’t agree with the suggested sum, his/her bet will be viewed as valid until the given event ends.</p><p>6.3. Cashout function is available after making a bet before the event ends. The sum suggested for the bet can change depending on some terms (for example, bet amount, event odds, event odds at the moment of using the Cashout function, discount defined by the organizer. The latest is decided by the organizer).</p><p>6.4. In case of using Cashout function, the suggested sum is paid to the participant in the prescribed way. Organizer can turn on/off Cashout function by his/her discretion.</p><p>&nbsp;6.5. If the Cashout function is active, the user has the opportunity to close his bet not only completely, but also partially before the end of the event. That is, he insures part of the bet, receiving the insured amount for it, and the other part continues to remain in the game. In this case, the user clicks on the appropriate button, which indicates the amount of the insurance offered by the organizer, and then a window opens in which he chooses what amount he wants to insure and confirms it by clicking on the appropriate button. The user is provided with the insured amount, with the deduction of the discount set by the organizer, and the remaining amount with the same odds continues to remain in the game.</p><p>For example, the user make a bet of 1,000 EUR with 2.2 odds. In case of win, the win amount will be 2,200 EUR (1,000 x 2.2). If the odds remains unchanged, the amount of insurance offered by the organizer will be 900 EUR – the discount set by the organizer (1,000 - 1,000 x 10%) is deducted from the bet amount.</p><p>If the odds changes, for example, becomes 1.5, in this case the amount to be insured is calculated as follows: the ratio of coefficients (2.2/1.5) is multiplied by the bet amount, then the discount set by the organizer is deducted from the result (2.2/1.5 x 1,000) - (2.2/1.5 x 1,000) x 10% = 1.320 EUR. That is, as a result of changing the odds, the amount offered by the organizer to be insured will amount to 1,320 EUR. If the user wants to insure 100 AMD, the organizer deducts 10% of this amount, i.e. 10 EUR as a discount, and 90 EUR is transferred to the user’s gaming account. The game remains (1,000 x 1,220/1,320) = 924 EUR.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>6.6. In case of Partial Cashout of bets made over the Internet, the insured amount is transferred to the user’s gaming account, and the Betslip with the remaining amount and the same odds remains in the game.</p><p>7.The main types of bets / Bets on the actual result of the event</p><p>&nbsp;7.1. You can make a bet on the outcome of the event without taking into account the handicap, if the appropriate odds are given (win of the first participant of the event is specified in the program as “W1”, the draw – “X”, win of the second participant of the event – “W2”). In this case the outcome of the bet is the actual result of the event. You can bet that the first team (participant of the event) will not lose – “1X”, any of the teams will win, i.e. the match will not end with draw - “12”, the second team (participant of the event) will not lose – “X2”, if the appropriate odds are given.</p><p>7.2. Bets on win of the participant of the event taking into account the handicap. Double Asian handicap and score handicap</p><p>&nbsp;-Double Asian handicap (Double bet on handicap)</p><p>&nbsp;This is a bet with handicap where the value of the handicap is pided by 0.25 without remainder, but not by 0.5. For example, -0.25, +0.25, or -0.75, +0.75, but not 0, -1, +1, -1.5, +1.5, etc.</p><p>&nbsp;Double bet on total</p><p>&nbsp;This is a bet with total where the value of the total is pided by 0.25 without remainder, but not by 0.5. For example, 2.25, 2.75, 3.25, but not 2, 2.5, 3, etc.</p><p>Such bets are considered to be two separate bets at half the bet amount with the same odds and with the ordinary value of the nearest common handicaps and totals: H“-0.75” = H“-0.5” and H“-1”, Total“2.25” = Total“2” and Total“2.5”.</p><p>Let us suppose that the handicap is “-0.25”, and the odds – “2.2”. Stake of 10 EUR with handicap “-0.25” and odds “2.2” means that there are two bets placed:</p><p>5 EUR with handicap “0” and odds “2.2”, and</p><p>5 EUR with handicap “-0.5” and odds “2.2”.</p><p>Let us suppose that the total is “2.75”, and the odds of over “2.75” – “2.4”. Stake of 10 EUR on total over “2.75” with odds “2.4” means that there are two bets placed:</p><p>5 EUR on total over “2.5” with odds “2.4”,</p><p>5 EUR on total over “3” with odds “2.4”.</p><p>&nbsp;Depending on the aforementioned information and the ordinary value of the handicap and total there are 4 possible cases for calculating the bet:</p><p>1. The bet is completely won (both parts of the bet are won). It is calculated as the product of the bet amount and odds.</p><p>2. Half of the bet is won, the other half is refunded. It is calculated as the product of the bet amount and odds (Odds +1)/2.</p><p>3. Half of the bet is lost, the other half is refunded. It is calculated as the product of the bet amount and number 0.5.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>7.3.

Let us consider the above-mentioned cases based on the data table:</p><p>1. We made a bet of 10 EUR with handicap “-0.25” (seen as two bets - 5 EUR with handicap “0” and odds “2.2”, and 5 EUR with handicap “-0.5” and odds “2.2”). The match ended with a 2:1 score. The bet is completely won.</p><p>The winning amount is 10 EUR x 2.2 = 22 EUR.</p><p>2. We made a bet of 10 EUR on Total over “2.75” (seen as two bets - 5 EUR on total over “2.5” with odds “2.4”, and 5 EUR on total over “3” with odds “2.4”). The match ended with a 2:1 score. Half of the bet is won, the other half is refunded.</p><p>The winning amount is 10 EUR x (2.4 x 1)/2 = 17 EUR.</p><p>3. We made a bet of 10 EUR with handicap “-0.25” (seen as two bets - 5 EUR with handicap “0” and odds “2.2”, and 5 EUR with handicap “-0.5” and odds “2.2”). The match ended with a 1:1 score. Half of the bet is lost, the other half is refunded.The winning amount is 10 EUR x 0.5 = 5 EUR.</p><p><br></p><p>4. We made a bet of 10 EUR on Total over “2.75” (seen as two bets - 5 EUR on total over “2.5” with odds “2.4”, and 5 EUR on total over “3” with odds “2.4”). The match ended with a score 1:1.The bet is completely lost (both parts of the bet are lost).</p><p>&nbsp;In case if the double bet is included in the accumulator bet or system the odds are calculated the same way as in case of a single bet.</p><p>8. Score handicap</p><p>&nbsp;8.1. There may be bets the odds of which will be based on the score of the match which will emerge after modifying the current score by handicap (imaginary score). That is to say, the bet is offered based on the imaginary (modified by handicap) score of the match.</p><p>8.2. The score which was actually recorded after the match and modified by handicap is considered to be the score of the match for calculating the placed bets.</p><p>Let us suppose that the current score of the match is 0:0, and the odds offered for the outcome of the match are as follow in table 1.</p><p>Table 1: the current score (0:0)</p><p>N<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>Date<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Event<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>W1<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>X<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>W2</p><p>1<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>01/01/11<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Team1 – Team2<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>1.4<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>4<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>6.8</p><p>Let us suppose that the current score of the match is (0:0), the handicap – (0:1).

In this case the imaginary (modified by handicap) score of the match will be (1:0), based on which there may be bets on the outcome of the match according to the odds in table 3:</p><p>Table 3: the current score (0:0), handicap (1:0)</p><p>N<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Date<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Event<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>W1<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>X<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>W2</p><p>1<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>01/01/11<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Team1 – Team2<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>1.18<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>5.8<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>11</p><p>For example, let us suppose that the match ended with a score 1:0.

The score of the match modified by handicap (1:0) (imaginary) will be 2:3, based on which the bets on W2 (win of the second team) will win, and the bets on W1 and X will be considered to be lost (Table 3).</p><p>Bets on the total number of goals scored, points earned, games played, etc. by the participant(s) of the event.</p><p>In the program this number is called “total”, which is offered with two outcomes: over and under. In case of coincidence with the total the bet amount is refunded. In case of a bet placed on the total being even or odd the result 0:0 (zero-zero) is considered even.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;9. Bets on the time when a certain event will take place.</p><p>E.g. when the first corner, first goal, etc. will take place. The seconds are not taken into account for calculating the bets. E.g. if the first goal was scored at 10 min. 07 sec. it is considered to be 11th min., 10 min. 59 sec. is considered 11th min., and 11 min. 00 sec. is considered 12th min.</p><p>&nbsp;Bets on win in competitions or qualifying for the next round.</p><p>&nbsp;At Organizer’s discretion other kinds of betting may be offered.There may be bets offered for predicting the outcomes of two and more events.</p><p>&nbsp;Example 1: win of the first team and total over 2.5 goals,</p><p>Example 2: the first team will win, the number of cautions (yellow cards) will be over 3.5 and the number of corner kicks will be under 10, etc.,</p><p>Example 3: the first team will kick off, the second team will score the first goal and the match will end in a draw.</p><p>The bet is considered to be won if the outcomes of all the included events have been predicted correctly.</p><p>The bet is refunded if at least one of the outcomes of the included event is refunded, and the others are considered to be won.</p><p>Suppose:</p><p>In example 1 the match was interrupted on the 15th minute of the match when the score was 2:1 and wasn’t continued (the match was considered to be incomplete),</p><p>In example 2 the match ended with a score 1:0, the number of cautions (yellow cards) is 5, and the number of corner kicks – 10.</p><p>10. Promotions and bonuses</p><p>&nbsp;10.1.The Organizer provide bonuses and opportunity to participate in current promotions to those participants who use the Organizer’s services for enjoyment. Free bets, bonuses and access to promotions will be annulled or canceled for those players who abuses the spirit of such an offer. The Organizer reserves the right to annul a bonus at any time in case of abuse and close the abuser’s account immediately. “Abuse” includes but is not limited to opening several accounts in order to obtain several bonuses. First of all participants can withdraw bonus sums from the remaining deposits, after which only from the bonus amount of the gaming account. The Organizer reserves the right to annul the bonus given to the participant if the bonus was not used for betting. The Organizer also has a right to cancel bonuses and winnings from betting in the full or partial amount of the bonus sum, if the Organizer suspects the bonus has been abused.</p><p>10.2.The participant can receive or use only those offers that are available to him/her. The Organizer reserves the right to at any time and for any reason change the conditions of bonus distribution and the group of participants for whom bonuses are available. The Organizer also has a right by its sole discretion and at any time to offer a special bonus to a certain client or group of clients, to cancel bonus offer without any warning or compensation, to change the conditions of the bonus offer and/or to replace one bonus offer with another.</p><p>10.3.Within such promotions (including but not limited to “Cash Back”, “Welcome Deposit Bonus”, “Refer a friend” and “Free bets”) only 1 bonus is available for every email address, credit card and e-payment account.</p><p>&nbsp;11. Bonus for Multi Bets with certain number of bets and certain odds</p><p>11.1. In order to increase the possible winning of the user, the organizer reserves the right to determine an additional multiplier for those multi bets that meet certain requirements. Such requirements can include some special bets, a certain minimal number of events in the Multi, the minimum odds of the events, as well as combinations of these conditions and/ or other conditions. In case of the requirements are met, user’s winning is multiplied by the additional multiplier. In some cases the organizer may define multi bet with certain fixed events, set the minimum amount of the stake and define the odds.</p><p>Example 1. For a Multi containing at least 10 events the Organizer has set an additional multiplier equal to 1.1, and for Multi containing at least 4 events with odds equal to at least 1.7 the Organizer has set an additional multiplier equal to 1.2.</p><p>Option 1: The User has selected multi bet containing 10 events with total odds of 20. In the event this multi wins, the winning will be multiplied by 1.1, which is the multiplier (for example, if the bet was 1000 EUR, then the final winning will be 1000 x 20 x 1.1 = 22000 EUR).</p><p>Option 2: The User has selected multi containing 5 events each with odds of 2. The odds of multi is equal to 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 32. In the event this multi wins the winning will be multiplied by 1.2, which is the multiplier (for example, if the bet was 1000 EUR, then the final winning will be 1000 x 32 x 1.2 = 38400 EUR).</p><p>Option 3: The user has chosen multi bet containing 10 events with odds of 2 for each event, the total odds is equal to 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 1024. This multi meets the conditions of both first and second Multi. In the event this multi wins the final winning will be multiplied by 1.2, which is the multiplier (for example, if the bet was 1000 EUR, then the final winning will be 1000 x 1024 x 1.2 = 1228800 EUR.</p><p>Example 2: The Organizer has defined a multi containing 15 certain events and set the amount of the stake to be 1000 EUR. In case of correct prediction for 15 events out of 15 the total odds for the Multi will be 1000 EUR, in case of correct prediction for 14 out of 15 events the total odds will be 600, in case of correct prediction for 13 out of 15 events the total odds will be 300. In case of correct prediction for 3 and more events incorrectly, the multi bet will be lost.</p><p>In case of correct prediction for 15 events the participant will receive 1000 x 1000 = 1000000 EUR, by predicting 14 events 1000 x 600 = 600000 EUR and by predicting 13 events - 1000 x 300 = 300000 EUR.</p><p>&nbsp;11.2.\"Top Multi\" bonus</p><p>&nbsp;11.2.1. By the Organizer’s discretion additional odds can be provided for the multi bet constructed from a certain combination of the outcomes of randomly chosen number of events. Such multi is called “Top Multi”. Thus, if we take into account the additional multiplied odds (which is defined by the organizer) the final odds of this multi will be higher than the sum of multiplied odds of the events of the multi. The events offered for “Top Multi” by the organizer can be chosen either from current or yet to be completed events. Several “Top Multis” can be available simultaneously. The number of outcomes of events in a “Top Multi” is defined by the organizer, and the changes made by the participant result in losing the multiplied odds. The Organizer sets the time period during which “Top Multi” is available, such multi can be added on the website and into the organizer system or deleted from the website and the system without previous notice. The Organizer can also define the minimal bet amount for “Top Multi”.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, the organizer declared the following outcomes of events to be “Top Multi’:</p><p>Event<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>Event outcome<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>Winning odds</p><p>Inter M. - Ajax<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>W1<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>1.5</p><p>Bayer L. - Mainz<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>X<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>3</p><p>Sharapova M. – Ivanovich A.<span style=\"white-space:pre\">  </span>W2<span style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>2.5</p><p>The additional multiplied odds for the Top Multi is 1.2, and the stake is 1000 EUR.</p><p>In case the results of the three indicated events are correctly predicted by the participant, his/her win will be 1,000 x 1.5 x 3 x 2.5 x 1.2 = 13500 EUR, where 1000 EUR is the participant’s bet amount, 1.5, 3 and 2.5 are the odds of the according outcomes of the events, and 1.2 is the additional multiplied odds of the multi. As you can see in the equation, participant’s bet is multiplied by the according odds of all events and by the additional multiplied odds of the “Top Multi”.</p><p>12. Bonus odds for re-betting the win</p><p>&nbsp;12.1. In case of a winning bet the participant has a right to place another bet with the winning sum or its part, without making a deposit via cash or transfer. In this case the organizer has a right to define the additional multiplied odds that is only available for the winning bets. The Organizer can limit the number of such bets without additional multiplied odds, as well as change the group of such bets without previous notice. The organizer defines the additional multiplied odds which can be different for different bets and sports. The organizer can change the additional multiplied odds without previous notice.</p><p>For example, the participant placed a bet and won 1000 EUR. At the moment of placing a new bet the organizer defined the additional multiplied odds for “Single” and “Multi” bets to be 1.1 and 1.2 accordingly.</p><p>Option 1: The participant has not withdrawn the winning amount and decides to place a new bet which is a single bet with odds 2.0. In case this new bet wins the total winning sum of the participant will be 1000 x 2.0 x 1.1 = 2200 EUR.</p><p>Option 2: The participant has not withdrawn the winning amount and decides to place a new bet which is a multi-bet with odds 4.0. In case this new bet wins the total winning sum of the participant will be 1000 x 4.0 x 1.2 = 5000 EUR.</p><p>&nbsp;13. Refer-a-Friend promotion</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>13.1.

If 5 (five) goals were scored by the same player in a match, this does not mean that both a hat-trick and a double were fixing as a result of these 5 (five) goals, but is calculated based on the outcome of the final result. If two or more of the above outcomes made by different players were registered in the match, then bets on these outcomes are considered to be won.</p><p>For example, in the same match, both a double and a poker made by two different players were registered, then bets on the “Fixed double” and “Fixed poker” outcomes are considered to be the winners.</p><p>&nbsp;- Bets on how this goal will be scored.</p><p>&nbsp;a) there will be an own goal (if the player scores a goal in his own goal).</p><p>b) header (if the goal into the rival’s goal was scored by a header).</p><p>c) from a free kick (if the goal into the rival’s goal was scored from a free kick without drawing the ball; a goal scored with a right corner kick is also considered a goal from a free kick).</p><p>d) from a penalty (if the goal was scored by a direct kick; when calculating the bet does not take into account the goal scored from the played or kicked penalty).</p><p>e) from the game (if the goal was scored from the game with a kick or other acceptable way, except for a header, and if the goal was not scored either from a free kick or a penalty and was not fixed as an own goal).</p><p>&nbsp;- Bets: will the team come from behind to win the match or not.</p><p>&nbsp;\"Come from behind\" means the final win of a team after being in a losing position at any time during the match.</p><p>&nbsp;- Bets on the total amount of numbers on the shirts of the players who scored goals – “Total is over (under) the total number”.</p><p>&nbsp;The players who scored own goals are not considered when calculating the bets.

In this case, it is considered the second player won the 6th game of the 2nd set.</p><p>If a match is delayed or interrupted, bets on its outcome remain valid until the end of the tournament in which it was held.</p><p>&nbsp;Bets on other possible outcomes in tennis matches are also accepted and they will be offered by the organizer in the Line.</p><p>&nbsp;Bets on Volleyball and Beach Volleyball</p><p>In volleyball matches it is played from 3 to 5 sets. The first team to win three sets wins the match, and the first team to reach 25 points wins the set (in the 5th final set – 15 points), with an advantage of at least 2 points over the opponent. When the score is 24:24 for the set, and it is 14:14 for the final set, then the set continues until one of the teams reaches 2-point advantage over the opponent in the current score of the set or the final set.
